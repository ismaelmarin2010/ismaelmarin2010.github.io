					<h2>QuickBooks</h2>

					<p>
						QuickBooks has two core offerings that overlap functionality, but users can switch between 
						one or the other to quickly increase or decrease capability and capacity as needed. QuickBooks 
						Enterprise integrates with other commonly used applications like Salesforce, DocuSign, PayPal 
						and ecommerce apps like Shopify. These integrations remove the need to recapture or export data 
						during times of rapid growth.
